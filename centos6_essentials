#comes with python/2.7.5, but I'll install 2.7.10 and make that the default.

#PURPOSE: Installs many core packages on top of the centos:centos6 base image, along with the following programming languages - 
# 1) JRE v1.8.0_91
# 2) R v3.2.3
# 3) Python 2.7.10
# 4) Perl v5.10.1 (as part of the "Developoment Tools" yum package). This doesn't come with cpan, cpanm, or cpanp. I was unable to install
#    cpanm using the instruction at http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/App-cpanminus-1.7043/lib/App/cpanminus.pm to run 
#    "curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus". It will be best to redo the Perl install from source.

#INSTALL some core packages.
# gcc-c++ needed for running g++ to make tools, such as Bowtie2.
# gcc needed for installing Python.
# lapack-dev blas-dev for installing scipy in Python.
# Development Tools installs 28 packages, and their dependencies. The number of dependencies installed on a base image of centos:centos6 were 101, notably of which are Perl v5.10.1, git v1.7.1, unzip
